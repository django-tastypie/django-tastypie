v0.12.0
=======

:date: 2014-09-11

This release adds official support for both Django 1.7, as well as
several bugfixes.

.. warning::

  If you were previously relying on importing the ``User`` model from
  ``tastypie.compat``, this import will no longer work correctly. This was
  removed due to the way app-loading works in Django 1.7 & no great solution
  for dodging this issue exists.

  If you were using either of::

    from tastypie.compat import User
    from tastypie.compat import username_field

  Please update your code as follows::

    from tastypie.compat import get_user_model
    from tastypie.compat import get_username_field
